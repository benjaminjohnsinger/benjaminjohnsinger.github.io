I'm Ben, a postdoctoral researcher in [Joe Lewnard's research group](https://joelewnard.github.io/joelewnard/) in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. My interests are in mathematical and computational modelling of infectious diseases. I have a particular eye towards work with applications improving pandemic preparedness and global health equity. I'm currently attached to the [C-CORE](insightnet.us/centers/c-core/) centre of Insight Net, the CDC Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics' project to improve outbreak response through collaboration between analytic experts and government.

## Current projects

- Understanding respiratory virus dynamics with data from pathogen re-emergence in Southern California
![A figure illustrating the relationship between viral dynamic parameters and post-COVID-19 re-emergence behaviour.](assets/img/parameter_sets_R0_immunity1_combi_2d.png)

- Examining data on respiratory virus testing for signatures of viral interaction
![A figure showing odds ratios between different viral infections, adjusting for bias.](assets/img/viral_interference_heatmap_wMbias_full_small.png)

- Characterizing the relationship between antibiotic consumption and resistance
![A figure showing the number of preventable deaths through reductions in antibiotic consumption for different pathogens.](assets/img/10pc_avertable_attributable_burden_by_pathogen_joelike_weighted_w_GASP.png)

- Supporting a range of student projects in the Lewnard group
