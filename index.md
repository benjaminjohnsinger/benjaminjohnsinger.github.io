# Benjamin J Singer

I'm Ben, a postdoctoral researcher in [Joe Lewnard's research group](https://joelewnard.github.io/joelewnard/) in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. My interests are in mathematical and computational modelling of infectious diseases. I have a particular eye towards work with applications improving pandemic preparedness and global health equity. I'm currently attached to the C-CORE center of Insight Net, the CDC Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics' project to improve outbreak response through collaboration between analytic experts and government.

## Current projects

- Understanding respiratory virus dynamics with data from pathogen re-emergence in Southern California

- Examining data on respiratory virus incidence for signatures of viral interaction

- Characterizing the relationship between antibiotic consumption and resistance

- Supporting a range of student projects in the Lewnard group
