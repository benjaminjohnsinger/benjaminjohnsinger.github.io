I'm Ben, a postdoctoral researcher in [Joe Lewnard's research group](https://joelewnard.github.io/joelewnard/) in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. My interests are in mathematical and computational modelling of infectious diseases. I have a particular eye towards work with applications improving pandemic preparedness and global health equity. I'm currently attached to the [C-CORE](insightnet.us/centers/c-core/) centre of Insight Net, the CDC Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics' project to improve outbreak response through collaboration between analytic experts and government.

## Current projects
